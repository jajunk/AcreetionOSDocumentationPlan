```

or 

```
git clone git@github.com:AcreetionOS/AcreetionOS.git
```

2. Move into the AcreetionOS directory:

Move into the directory that just clone with cd by running:

```
cd AcreetionOS/
```

3. Run build.sh

Run the build.sh by running:

```
chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh
```

If this does not work, run: 

```
chmod +x build.sh && bash build.sh
```

In the case you can't get it to build, make an issue up above!
