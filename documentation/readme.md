# AcreetionOS Linux

Welcome to AcreetionOS Linux, an open-source project aimed at providing the user a stable and up-to-date experience.

## Project Overview

AcreetionOS Linux is a community-driven effort to build a lightweight, versatile Linux distribution. AcreetionOS Linux is currently based on Arch Linux, but the future goal is to be a parallel* distribution with our own base. Our goal is to provide a solid foundation for both everyday users and developers, with a focus on simplicity, ease of use, and stability; all while keeping packages up to date.

## Features

- Lightweight base system
- Standardized Package Selection
- User-friendly installation process
- x86_64 friendly.

## Getting Started
